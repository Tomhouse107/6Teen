							<button class="collapsible"><h3>Team Personality Tests</h3></button>
								<div class="content1">

									<p>
										Every member of our team has taken a few online tests so that we can learn about ourselves and optimise our team functionality. A personality test, a learning test and a test of the team members choice have been completed and we used the information gathered to help determine the best way our team could operate.<br>
										We all started by sourcing the 16 Personalities Myers-Briggs Test. The test tells us about our personality in 4 areas just like the Myers-Briggs Test, however It has the addition of one more factor called ‘Identity’. This factor underpins all the other scales by determining how confident we are in our decisions.
									</p>
									<button class="collapsible" style="width:80% "><h4>16 Personalities Myers-Briggs Test</h4></button>
									<div class="content1">
									<h4>Adam’s Results:</h4>
									<p>
										With the 16Personalities.com analysis Adam was described as an "Architect" which has the acronym INTJ. The Architect personality type is one that only makes up 2% of the population. Architects are proud of the knowledge that they gain and like to share It with others. They believe that anything is possible with enough effort and thought. When Adam reflects on his results, he can conclude that it does describe him well. Bearing this in mind, he realises that he must concentrate a little more on working as part of a team rather than taking on the project on his own. Adam understands that his positive traits will also surface in a team-based role and that the work will speak for itself.
									</p>
									<h4>Allan’s Results:</h4>
									<p>
										From Allan’s testing, a low extraversion score is shown over all his tests, meaning he is less likely to put himself into social situations. He is also more likely to sway towards situations that are familiar to him rather than trying new experiences.
										People with this ISTP personality type are natural makers, enjoying moving from project to project and building the useful and the superfluous for the fun of it. They also regularly learn from their environment as they go. 
										While Allan finds the potential insights from these different tests interesting, he does find himself skeptical of their ability to predict his behaviours in professional settings and when working in teams.
										 
										The breakdown for Allan’s test results are as follows:
									</p>
									<table style="width:100%">
										<tr><th>Area</th>	<th>Result</th></tr>
										<tr><td>Introversion vs. Extroversion</td>	<td>Highly Introverted - 82%</td></tr>
										<tr><td>Observant vs. Intuitive</td> <td>Moderately Observant - 56%</td></tr>
										<tr><td>Thinking vs. Feelings</td>	<td>Moderately 'Thinking' - 57%</td></tr>
										<tr><td>Judging vs Prospecting</td>	<td>Moderately 'Prospecting' - 60%</td></tr>
										<tr><td>Assertive vs Turbulent</td>	<td>Highly 'Turbulent' - 83%</td></tr>
									</table>
									</p>

									<h5>Deon’s Results:</h5>
									<p>
										The results of this test show that he is best suited as an advocate diplomat. This has the character code of INFJ-T. He is there to lubricate the gears for a team so that everything keeps running smoothly. However, Deon realises that he should take care to put effort into the work that he does and not just to helping others. This personality type leads to a person who is a problem solver. They try to help others in need and usually want to eradicate the route of the problem while they are at it.
									</p>
									<h4>Kylie’s Results:</h4>
									<p>
										The results of Kylie’s Myers-Briggs personality test are INTP. This is a logician character. The basic aspects of this personality type are of a person who is quite logical, does not use emotions as a basis for understanding or making decisions and is quite often a loner. Their minds can often easily spot patterns and problems.
									</p>
									<h4>Tomas’ Results:</h4>
									<p>
									According to this test, Tomas is an INFP-T mediator. This means he is very idealistic, yet flexible and open-minded. It also means that he is creative and that he can combine his creativity and open-minded nature to be a very level-headed individual. The study says that Tomas has a hard-working and dedicated nature when challenges pop up that would deter most. However, the test also mentions some of the negative characteristics of such a person. For example, they can be impractical. Also being too idealistic can set them up for disappointment and therefore their morale can deteriorate. Tomas agrees with aspects of the test results but not all of them (which is expected). He believes that he is a hard worker and that he can also think too simply sometimes as we are not in an ideal world. However, Tomas is against the motion that he cannot see the bigger picture. Contrary to that, he thinks that he often only gets through situations by seeing the end goal.
									Overall, Tomas would say that the test is moderately accurate and so he must take it into consideration for teamwork. He should look for personalities that harmonise with his own yet would add substance for a good team. As a person who is idealistic, Tomas needs someone who can be realistic to bring his ideas back down to Earth. Also, as a rather dominant character he would need to be in a team without too many like-minded people or the project could get dragged in too many directions.
									</p>
									<h4>Conclusion</h4>
									<p>
										We can draw ideas from the data we have received to create a harmonious and effective team. As in any team, we require certain characteristics for a well-rounded unit. Some of these properties can include having a team leader who takes control and organise. We need some people who like to show their creative flare and others who like to plod on through to just get the work done. We can set up our team in a way that utilises our strengths and minimises our weaknesses. If we look at the data, we can see that Adam, being an architect, has great assets for leading a team and guiding others. Meanwhile Allan could be a valuable team mechanic. He can start sections, setting up the groundwork and then move onto another goal. Through Kylie’s logical thinking and Deon’s eye for problem fixing we could capitalise early on issues that may arise. This could allow us to quickly move past obstacles so that progress is not hindered. Tomas, on the other hand, could help navigate through dilemma’s by listening to two viewpoints and trying to negotiate an effective middle ground.
									</p>
									</div>
									<button class="collapsible" style="width:80%"><h4>Learning Test</h4></button>
									<div class="content1">
										<p>
											Adam, Deon and Tomas are predominantly visual learners, while Allan is a kinesthetic learner. Kylie is also a visual learner, but she, like Allan, learns through a kinesthetic approach as well. Visual learners use material that is right in front of them to help them understand something. They can appreciate graphical data and information in a textbook or on a whiteboard. It is a very traditional approach to gaining knowledge but for some of our team, this is the best way that they retain information. They can often enjoy drawing something out to use as a study tool that they can refer to. Demonstrations can be very important for visual learners as well as other visual representations of instruction.
											We also have two people in our group who learn through physical activities and ‘doing’ things. These characteristics of a kinesthetic learner can be aided by a hands-on approach. Sometimes ‘acting out’ or simulating ideas can help with retainment and learning.
											We also have people who will learn somethings through auditory mediums. Deon and Tomas have this as a way that they can affectively learn.
										</p>
										<h4>Conclusion</h4>
										<p>
											Having varied ways of learning throughout the team can be of great benefit as we can easily look at problems from all angles. If information is portrayed in a certain manner, we can be sure that someone will be able to understand due to our variety of learning preferences. However, due to us all learning in different ways, we must make sure that everyone is comfortable with the new information as there is no guarantee that everyone will understand.
										</p>
									</div>
									<button class="collapsible" style="width:80%"><h4>Test of Choice</h4></button>
									<div class="content1">
										<h5>Adam’s Situational Reasoning Test:</h5>
										<p>
											For Adam’s third test he thought to do something a little outside of the box. He completed a "Situational Reasoning Test" which covers situational awareness and evaluation of alternatives. It was a total of 24 questions which gave him a workplace situation and multiple choices from which Adam would choose the correct decision. After Adam finished, he was scored a total of 19/24 answers correct, which made Adam acknowledge that he may have to pay a little more attention and assess a situation completely before making a judgement. The score of 19/24 still makes him a good influence on the team and gives him a high probability of reacting the best way possible to most situations.
										</p>
										<h5>Allan’s Big 5 Personality Test:</h5>
										<p>
											Allan’s third test shows similar results to his Myers-Briggs test results. He is edging on the side of caution, scoring “low extraversion” and “highly neurotic”. He also received similar scores on characteristics to do with his open-minded nature.
										</p>
										<h5>Deon’s Big 5 Personality Test:</h5>
										<p>
											Deon’s third test was also a personality test. This indicates that he is high in agreeableness and openness. While interacting with people, Deon is likely to be swayed by new ideas or opinions. When working on a project he should make sure to stick with what is feasible and stick within constraints. The results for Deon are similar to what he scored in his Myer-Briggs Test. He is an open-minded team player.
										</p>
										<h5>Kylie’s Big 5 Personality Test:</h5>
										<p>
											Kylie does not agree with some of her results. She disagrees with the idea that she is an angry or self-conscious person. The test has given Kylie high scores for both, as well as scoring her highly in some respects that she specifically picked as less applicable to herself. It has also given her quite high scores in intelligence, creativity, morality and cooperation.
										</p>
										<h5>Tomas’ Creativity Test:</h5>
										<p>
											Tomas’ final test was a creativity test. The following test describes him as having a complex and abstract mind. This means that Tomas can produce abnormal concepts from ideas or information. The complex side of the test means that he can handle large quantities of information at once and be able to manipulate and manage the information well. It also claims that Tomas lacks the ability to make connections. 
											This means unless something has an original apparent connection, he may struggle to link the two concepts together.
											Tomas is not sure how much he agrees with this test. Normally, he would say that he is able to hand and manipulate information, but he is not convinced that he is not able to see new connections between ideas. Tomas would say that this is one of his strengths. The inaccuracy of the test could be purely down to the limited number of questions as creativity is such a complicated characteristic. Tomas also says that he probably would not use this test to identify good potential fits for team members whom he can work with. He wants to take a few more creativity tests to see what type of creativity he should be looking for in a team.
										</p>
										<h5>Conclusion:</h5>
										<p>
											Adam could use his newfound knowledge about his decision-making skills to influence his team in the correct way. He knows that he can trust his instincts and that he will be right most of the time. However, for the most part, these final tests would not allow our team to develop any decisions on how to work in a team as 3 out of the 5 tests gave our team members similar information to what they already had, Tomas did not agree with the information he learned in his creativity test and Kylie did not agree with her personality results.
										</p>

								</div>
							<button class="collapsible"><h3>Ideal Jobs</h3></button>
								<div class="content1">
									<p>
										For the most part, team 6Teen did not have many changed thoughts on their ideal jobs between assignment one, assignment two and now. However, we have extended our thoughts to cover a longer period of time and discuss some of our career plans and goals.<br>
										Adam, Deon, Kylie and Tomas, are all focused on coding and programming positions specifically. All of these positions require many more years of experience and training than any of the team currently have. In the case of Adam, Kylie and Deon, their chosen positions require previous experience in a similar position.
									</p>
									<button class="collapsible"><h4 class="card">Adam</h4></button>
									<div class="content1">
										<p>
											Adam’s chosen position as a software developer requires experience in customer service as well as the required coding knowledge in java and .Net. He also requires prior experience in a similar organisation as well as the ability to multitask and work on several projects at once. <br>
											Adam has decided to go down the path of becoming an independent game developer and programmer, after some thinking over and hard consideration, he believes that he would work much more efficiently. He is self-taught and he believes that he can achieve a lot by doing that. Adam has done some research and he has talked to developers in the game development industry and they have all told his that his portfolio is much more important than his degree. He will start by making his own projects, models, scripts etc. and then try kickstart his career through his portfolio or by creating his own independent company. 
										</p>
									</div>
									<button class="collapsible"><h4 class="card">Allan</h4></button>
									<div class="content1">
										<p>
											Allan was our outlier in his ideal position initially being in IT Support. Allan’s chosen career path involved a lot of customer service skills as well as an in-depth knowledge of the software (in this particular case, Windows) or the ability to find solutions and workarounds for his clients. Being a customer service-oriented position, his technical knowledge would not be enough without the ability to communicate well with clients, supervisors, and any other personnel working with him. <br>

											However, Allan’s career plans have deviated from the initial ideal job identified (helpdesk/ technical support) positioning himself instead, towards exploring the space, and while still having that ideal job in mind, not closing off to other opportunities and engagements. A helpdesk or technical support role does seem to suit his strengths and proclivities, but in studying this unit he has discovered an enjoyment and competence in other sections of the IT world that may end up being a more ideal fit for himself. With this newfound information in mind, his new career plan would be to complete the first round of tertiary education and begin looking for opportunities in the professional space leveraging my previous work experience in other fields. He would be looking for different jobs and opportunities that come along, instead of strategically moving towards a position, but instead making moves as chance allows, and exploring IT and his own interests. 
										</p>
									</div>
									<button class="collapsible"><h4 class="card">Deon</h4></button>
									<div class="content1">
										<p>
											Deon’s chosen position was a software engineer for VR and hardware. This position requires an extensive knowledge base and years of experience. Although not all jobs require this, having more experience will lead to a greater chance of obtaining such a role. Deon’s chosen role will require experience in game design, as well as specifically working with VR technology, interactions between humans and computers, and the use of software specific to the industry such as the game engines Unity and Unreal. Deon’s career pathway is centred around software development. <br>

											He has spent time researching into the space around it and feels that his options have broadened. His ideal job would require a large time investment, and Deon thinks that the stepping stones to getting there are just as interesting. His plan has changed and he knows that he must be much more open minded in terms of what it is that he could be. In his studies he has found that his interest in programming has elevated, and it has made him wish to start engaging himself into projects to develop his skills. His career plan has shifted into a more active one, in which he would be looking to either undertake projects in his own time or look for other opportunities to gain experience during his study. He would like to work with other people or organisations alongside studying his degree.
										</p>
									</div>
									<button class="collapsible"><h4 class="card">Kylie</h4></button>
									<div class="content1">
										<p>
											Kylie’s chosen position of mobile game developer also focuses on game development and the use of the Unity engine alongside learning other specific skills such as animation, coding in C#, and working specifically with 3D technologies, whether that was in games or other technologies. Her chosen position also requires previous experience developing a game that was successfully launched in the app or play store. <br>
											Kylie’s career plans are centred mostly around the ability to work remotely as her personal circumstances as a carer and rural living arrangements, would make working an office-based job in a city impractical. Remote working on code and game design would be ideal for Kylie and she harbours aspirations to one day start her own company that caters to the needs of others in similar positions to her own regarding work. While she would need to gain much experience in her chosen field before launching a company of her own, she does believe it is a worthwhile career goal to focus on long term.
										</p>
									</div>
									<button class="collapsible"><h4 class="card">Tomas</h4></button>
									<div class="content1">
										<p>
											Tomas chose a junior developer’s position as his ideal short-term position. This position requires the skills to develop, test, and maintain software. His chosen position also requires knowledge of several coding languages including C#, CSS and, JavaScript. Customer service skills and good communication are also listed as required for such a role, as it is for many in the industry. <br>
											Tomas’ career goals are split into a short-term and a long-term category and they are very different from each other. As a business-orientated individual, Tomas recognises that in the long-term, he probably will not be in the IT industry at all. He plans to work in the industry completing high quality work and providing the best for his clients in the short-term, but later on plans to go his own way and develop his own products in the food and beverage industry. 
										</p>								
								</div>
									<button class="collapsible"><h4 class="card">Comparison</h4></button>
									<div class="content1">
										<p>
											On the surface, all of us apart from Allan have very similar original ideal jobs in mind. It could be said that all of our ideal jobs are similar as they all ultimately have the common goal of creating better online features and networks. When we look deeper however while there is a lot of overlap in each of our positions there are some large differences as well. Allan, Adam and Tomas all chose careers where customer service skills were a must. Both Deon and Kylie have chosen positions that require previous game development and experience in the same game engines. Despite the shared experience, the actual positions require knowledge of different platforms and hardware, and do not have very many similarities once you move past the knowledge they require and into the work they are doing.<br>

											IT Support was a small sub-theme of our group’s goals in learning IT, with Tomas and Allan requiring these soft skills as a prominent part of their job. Programming skills were prominent across the board of us all, in some cases the chosen position requiring upward of 4 different programming languages. Allan’s ideal position remains our largest outlier, requiring learning the technical specifics of one program or system and all its functionalities. Each of our ideal career positions require previous experience working in similar companies and in some cases proving commercial success with those companies. <br>

											Despite each position being an aspect of IT and four of the five being in very similar sounding careers it is very clear that each of these positions are very far away from each other in terms of our chosen career routes. While there is a lot of overlap between the positions each of them is unique and the differences are quite large. It will be very interesting to see the directions they may end up taking us in the long term.<br>

											6Teens members have career plans that have various commonalities. For example, four of our five team members think that they will be involved in IT long-term, meanwhile Tomas thinks that he most likely will be in a different field later in his career. This is mainly due to his passions for other areas as opposed to him not wanting to be in the IT industry. Three of our members can see themselves starting a business later in their career as they learn more that they can use to put into action. Whilst the businesses purposes are undetermined currently, we do know that Adam and Kylie want a business in IT whereas Tomas would likely create one in a different field. There is a common theme throughout the team members as a few of them have said that for their career path, it is important that they take on personal projects and use these to show off to potential employers. Its recognised that one of the best ways for the team to learn, is to create programmes themselves and practice their code.<br>

								<div class="content1">
									<p>Overall, Team 6Teen worked well together in assignment two, as shown by the grade they received, however there were some issues that needed addressing for assignment three.  In most modules they recorded a high distinction and in some others a distinction was given. This demonstrates the ability that the group had, however, there is always room for improvement. In assignment three, 6Teen want to achieve a higher grade and show off their skills to the best of their ability. This is going to happen by taking their weaknesses of the last assignment, finding solutions for these problems, and implementing the solutions effectively.</p>

									<p>For the most part, the team were left to their own devices to finish work individually. The team then compiled most of the work in the final half of the last week to bring the entire assignment together as one. As team members completed parts of the assessment that they had volunteered to do, there were problems with communication. The main issue that they had, was time management.</p>

									<p>To fix this, 6Teen will be more organised and they will spread the workload over a longer period. Another factor holding the team back was their lack of leadership and clear direction. This has been recognised and solutions have been put in place. One member of the team is taking a more senior role and the workload will be more clearly designated so that people understand what tasks they should be completing. While the majority of our work will still be completed individually and the group coming together in the end to combine efforts, having a project manager to lead and direct the group will ensure that there are no double-ups and confusion, Hopefully this will lead to clear direction in which tasks will be done and who will be doing them.</p>

											<h2>IT Interest</h2>
											<p>
												I have had an interest in IT since I was i believe to be 6 years old, My mum and dad showed me our first computer and i was immediately transfixed by it. I played a game on an ABC website and didn't want to stop! ever since then i had a laid back approach to it, i used it for social reasons and gaming but never really decided to pursue knowledge on an academic level, however in my early teens i started to become curious about how to make my OWN programs. So i experimented, for the last 8 years i have been doing that on and off and only recently decided it was time to take my knowledge to the next level by studying a Bachelor in Information Technology with RMIT.

									        <p>
									        	Allan, born 21st of February 1995, grew up in Melbourne's Eastern Suburbs where he attended primary school known for its focus on German language and culture. His high school career was rocked by illness, moving onto studying at Distance Education before finishing his VCE certificate at a local high school. In his younger days Allan was very interested in soccer, playing for his local team as captain for several years before his interests changed. For the last three years Allan has been working at a local Martial Arts school as their program manager, keeping everything up and working and keeping students happy in their classes.

											<h2>IT Interest</h2>
											<p>
												My interest and experiences in IT started when I was young, with my father showing me simple programming in Visual Basic he learned for his job at a pneumatics factory in the late 90s. He showed me how to make simple visual interfaces to make text change and start to develop little games from big books that captivated me at the time. I took off from there in my explorations of IT, learning several different programming languages, at the time to make video games and eventually working at websites and physical hardware as well. This all stemmed from those late nights with my father, expanding my interest both at that time and moving on into the future of this complex and fascinating world of IT.
											</p>
											<h2>Career Plan</h2>
											<p>
												Allan was our outlier in his ideal position initially being in IT Support. Allan’s chosen career path involved a lot of customer service skills as well as an in-depth knowledge of the software (in this particular case, Windows) or the ability to find solutions and workarounds for his clients. Being a customer service-oriented position, his technical knowledge would not be enough without the ability to communicate well with clients, supervisors, and any other personnel working with him. 
											</p>
											<p>
												However, Allan’s career plans have deviated from the initial ideal job identified (helpdesk/ technical support) positioning himself instead, towards exploring the space, and while still having that ideal job in mind, not closing off to other opportunities and engagements. A helpdesk or technical support role does seem to suit his strengths and proclivities, but in studying this unit he has discovered an enjoyment and competence in other sections of the IT world that may end up being a more ideal fit for himself. With this newfound information in mind, his new career plan would be to complete the first round of tertiary education and begin looking for opportunities in the professional space leveraging my previous work experience in other fields. He would be looking for different jobs and opportunities that come along, instead of strategically moving towards a position, but instead making moves as chance allows, and exploring IT and his own interests.

									        	Hey there I am Deon. I grew up in a city called Wodonga in Victoria, Australia. I have completed year 12 and have prior experience studying Civil Engineering. I have since switched paths into the IT field after becoming deeply interested in the field of software development.  My hobbies are playing video games and playing pen and paper RPG games like DnD.

											<h2>IT Interest</h2>
											<p>
												IT is less of an interest for me and more a way of life. I started becoming interested in computers when I was very young around the age of 6 when my father and my older brothers upgraded from their old computer to one that ran Windows XP. Countless hours were spent on it and that trend continues until today with me piecing together my own at 16.
											</p>
											<h2>Career Plan</h2>
											<p>
												Deon’s chosen position was a software engineer for VR and hardware. This position requires an extensive knowledge base and years of experience. Although not all jobs require this, having more experience will lead to a greater chance of obtaining such a role. Deon’s chosen role will require experience in game design, as well as specifically working with VR technology, interactions between humans and computers, and the use of software specific to the industry such as the game engines Unity and Unreal. Deon’s career pathway is centred around software development. He has spent time researching into the space around it and feels that his options have broadened. His ideal job would require a large time investment, and Deon thinks that the stepping stones to getting there are just as interesting. 
											</p>
											<p>
												His plan has changed and he knows that he must be much more open minded in terms of what it is that he could be. In his studies he has found that his interest in programming has elevated, and it has made him wish to start engaging himself into projects to develop his skills. His career plan has shifted into a more active one, in which he would be looking to either undertake projects in his own time or look for other opportunities to gain experience during his study. He would like to work with other people or organisations alongside studying his degree.

									        <p>My name is Kylie and I am a single mother of 2 pre-teen children, one of which is autistic, I have come to study late in life in my mid 30’s to begin pursuing an education I can use to further my career prospects once my children are a little older. I only completed grade 10 in my high school days and have been a stay at home mother for 12 years, so I have found the learning and time management around children something of challenge. I live in North Queensland and have in fact, never even left the state. I love to play video games and you can find me reading (usually a fantasy series) at least once a day. My secret little hobby is gardening, specifically I really enjoy growing adenium desert roses, and normal roses in all their wonderful varieties, colours and species. I am not very good at it sad to say but I learn more each day. </p>

											<h2>IT Interest</h2>
											<p>My interest in IT started at a very young age, my Grandfather began working with computers and teaching himself everything he wanted to know in the early 90’s. We were quite close and so I was often with him as he built a computer, or fixed them, or just experimented for his own learning. We had all the gaming systems growing up, starting with the Atari and the family often spent weekends out in our garage playing the latest games together. As I got older, I began purchasing my own equipment and teaching myself how to build computers and fix problems, both software and hardware. My current PC was purchased nearly 14 years ago and has died and been repaired many times by myself, it is still going strong. I am fascinated with the concept of game design and coding and really enjoy reading the rise of small companies making amazing games. If those guys can do it, then maybe I can as well.</p>
											<h2>Career Plan</h2>
											<p>	
												Kylie’s chosen position of mobile game developer also focuses on game development and the use of the Unity engine alongside learning other specific skills such as animation, coding in C#, and working specifically with 3D technologies, whether that was in games or other technologies. Her chosen position also requires previous experience developing a game that was successfully launched in the app or play store. Kylie’s career plans are centred mostly around the ability to work remotely as her personal circumstances as a carer and rural living arrangements, would make working an office-based job in a city impractical. Remote working on code and game design would be ideal for Kylie and she harbours aspirations to one day start her own company that caters to the needs of others in similar positions to her own regarding work. While she would need to gain much experience in her chosen field before launching a company of her own, she does believe it is a worthwhile career goal to focus on long term.

									        	My name is Tomas. I am 21 years old and I am from a town just outside of North London. I now live in Australia (Brisbane to be precise) with my partner and her sister. In terms of hobbies, I enjoy sport a lot, including soccer and weightlifting. I want to soon take up boxing or Muay Thai but just have not gotten around to it yet. An interesting fact about me would be that I am currently looking into and trying to set up my own alcohol distillery with aims to turn it into a business in the future.

											<h2>IT Interest</h2>
											<p>
												As I have mentioned previously, IT has always been something I have enjoyed, I just never really gave it much more thought than that. I have always been the family “tech guy” even though I am pretty sure most of the things I can do are minor. Alas, it has given me some encouragement to try the subject in greater detail and maybe make a career out of it. Or at least it will always be a handy tool with how technology-based our society is nowadays. If I could choose an area that excites me the most, I would probably have to pick learning how to code in a new language. As difficult as it may be, being a rookie, I find it very interesting and especially satisfying when I finally figure out what something means after spending an extraordinary amount of time trying to make it work.
